Continuous Integration and Delivery
This application uses GitLab CI/CD for automating builds, tests, and deployments.

#### ▪️Pipeline Stages <a name = "pipeline_stages"></a>
The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file defines the following stages:

#### ▪️Build Stage <a name = "build_stages"></a>
This stage has two parallel jobs:

- **backend-build-job:** Builds the Spring Boot backend application using Maven.
  - Uses Maven Docker image.
  - Runs `mvn clean install` to compile and package the backend.
  - Saves the generated JAR file as a build artifact.

- **frontend-build-job:** Builds the React frontend application using Yarn.
  - Uses Node Docker image.
  - Runs `yarn install` to install dependencies.
  - Runs `yarn build` to create a production build.
  - Saves the frontend build artifacts.

#### ▪️Test Stage <a name = "test_stages"></a>
- **backend-test-job:** Runs JUnit tests for backend code.
  - Uses Maven Docker image.
  - Runs `mvn verify` to execute unit tests.
  - Frontend tests are commented out for now.

#### ▪️Publish Stage <a name = "publish_stages"></a>
Builds Docker images for the backend and frontend.
- Tags images with Git commit SHA for traceability.
- Pushes images to Docker Hub repository.
![Image](./readme/dockerHub.png "Docker hub")


#### ▪️Deploy Stage <a name = "deploy_stages"></a>
Deploys the application to the production server (IP `172.17.1.123`).
- Connects to the server via SSH using a private key.
- Pulls the latest images from Docker Hub.
- Stops any existing containers.
- Starts new containers with the latest images.

#### ▪️Docker Containers <a name = "docker_container"></a>
- `my-app-backend` for the backend, exposes port `8073`.
- `my-app-ui` for the frontend, exposes port `8074`.
  - Port `8074` on the server maps to port `5173` inside the frontend container.

#### ▪️Deployment Access <a name = "deployment_access"></a>
- Backend: [http://172.17.1.123:8073](http://172.17.1.123:8073) (for internal consumption)
- Frontend: [http://172.17.1.123:8074](http://172.17.1.123:8074) (Publicaly exposed)

# ☑️ Quality <a name = "quality"></a>

## ▪️Design principles <a name = "design_principles"></a>


- <h4> Single Responsibility Principle </h4>

  <p> The Single Responsibility Principle dictates that a class should have a singular responsibility, promoting the separation of concerns and facilitating the modification, testing, and reuse of code. This principle is being adhered to in several instances where we are creating distinct controllers and services for various stakeholders. </p>

- <h4>Open/Closed Principle (OCP) </h4>

  <p>"A class should be open for extension but closed for modification" means that a class's behavior can be extended without modifying its source code. We have implemented this principle in our application by creating separate classes for different types of users. </p>

- <h4>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</h4>

  <p>Subtypes should be able to replace their base types without changing the correctness of the program. As a result, we ensure that if any class implements an abstract class or interface, it can fully replace its parent class.</p>

- <h4>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</h4>

  <p>The Interface Segregation Principle advocates for the use of smaller, more specialized interfaces instead of larger, more complex ones. This approach enables easier maintenance, testing, and code reuse. To implement this principle, we have designed separate interfaces for specific tasks. For example, we have a dedicated mail service interface responsible solely for sending mails, without including unnecessary methods that users would have to implement during implementation. By segregating interfaces in this way, we ensure that our application remains organized and manageable.</p>

- <h4>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</h4>

  <p>To promote modularity and extensibility, the principle suggests that modules should rely on abstractions such as interfaces and abstract classes. To reduce dependencies on individual classes and decouple the components, we employ numerous interfaces and classes. As we're using Spring Boot for our application, we don't need to be too concerned about this principle because the framework is based on SOLID principle.</p>

## ▪️Other clean code practices (FrontEnd) <a name = "other_clean"></a>
1.  We've separated CSS and JavaScript for improved maintainability and readability.
2.  Our vite.config.js is organized to enhance readability and manage different aspects of the build process efficiently.
3.  In LoginSignup.constant.js, we've defined action types and string constants, adhering to the DRY principle and ensuring consistency.
4.  Our reducers, like in LoginSignup.reducer.js, define an initial state, providing a clear understanding of our data structure and default values.
5.  We use a clear structure with switch statements in our reducers for handling different action types, enhancing code readability.
6.  Our action creators, as seen in LoginSingup.actions.js, provide a consistent method for dispatching actions, facilitating maintainability.
7.  Across our files, we use descriptive variable and function names, making our code self-explanatory.
8.  We've organized our files to separate concerns (constants, actions, reducer), aiding in maintainability and scalability.
9.  We maintain a consistent coding style across all files to ensure readability and maintainability.
10. In complex logic sections, like in our reducers, we use comments to clarify the purpose of code blocks.
11. We use constants instead of hard-coded values to avoid magic numbers/strings, enhancing code readability and maintainability.1
12. Our functions are designed to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle.
13. We ensure proper indentation and spacing in our code formatting for enhanced readability.
14. We use arrow functions for a concise and modern approach in our JavaScript files.
15. In our state management, as seen in reducers, we handle the state immutably, crucial for Redux-like architectures.
16. We implement robust error handling mechanisms throughout our code.
17. Consistent Naming Conventions: Our naming conventions are consistent, aiding in understanding the codebase.
18. We separate logic (JS files) from presentation, following best practices in frontend development.
19.  Our code utilizes modern JavaScript features, reflecting up-to-date and efficient coding practices.
20. Our file structure is designed to be scalable, accommodating the growth of the project.
